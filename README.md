## Hi there 👋

I have been a hobbyist for over a decade from a distance. It is time to take action towards leaving a footprint. 

I have experience in Python, JavaScript, & C++.

Current project goals are to:
- create a website
- build useful personal tools
- local ai

I have a passion in cybersecurity. Finding information others can not. Gaining access through parameters someone felt safe to deploy. Staying safe through defensive measures. Offensive for recon and prepatation only.
